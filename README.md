This dashboard displays information on road accidents, including the total number of casualties, casualties by vehicle type, casualties by road type, and casualties by road surface. It also provides information on casualties by location, casualties by day/night, and filters for further analysis.

Here's a breakdown of the information presented in the dashboard:

* **Total Casualties:** This section displays the total number of casualties involved in road accidents.
* **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** This section shows the number of casualties according to the type of vehicle involved in the accident. 
* **Casualties by Road Type:** This section shows the number of casualties according to the type of road where the accident occurred (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout, etc.).
* **Casualties by Road Surface:** This section shows the number of casualties according to the surface condition of the road where the accident happened (e.g., dry, snow/ice).
* **Casualties by Location:** This section provides information on the location where the accidents took place. 
* **Casualties by Day/Night:** This section shows the number of casualties according to the time of day when the accident happened (i.e., daylight or dark).

The dashboard also includes a filter panel that allows users to filter the data based on specific criteria. This can help users to gain a more focused understanding of the data and identify trends.
